This package contains Siena, a wide-area event notification system.
In particular, this is Siena-2, a package containing the Java API and
a Java router that implements the B-DRP routing scheme[1] as well as
the SFF matching and forwarding algorithm[2].

DOCUMENTATION:

The API documentation is automatically generated in doc/index.html.
See below for some basic usage documentation.

This version of Siena comes with a minimalistic build system based on
the typical configure-and-make process.  This type of build process
may not be ideal for a Java project, and of course some developers may
prefer a different build process, perhaps performed within an
integrated development environment.  However, this document describes
this somewhat more primitive process, whith is the process followed by
the main maintainer of Siena.

INSTALLATION:

Two separate build methods are provided. One with GNU Autotools
and the other with Apache Ant. See the INSTALL and INSTALL.ant 
files for details on how to use each one to build Siena.
