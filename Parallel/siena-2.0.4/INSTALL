INSTALLATION:

This version of Siena comes with a minimalistic build system based on
the typical configure-and-make process.  This type of build process
may not be ideal for a Java project, and of course some developers may
prefer a different build process, perhaps performed within an
integrated development environment.  However, this document describes
this somewhat more primitive process, whith is the process followed by
the main maintainer of Siena.

* Building Siena From a Clean Source Repository (e.g., cloned by git):

  If you are building and installing Siena from a source repository,
  then you must first bootstrap the build environment.  To do that,
  you need to have GNU Autoconf installed.  Then, assuming you have a
  clean source repository in $HOME/src/siena:

  0. > cd $HOME/src/siena
     > autoconf

  Then proceed with the build instruction from step 1 below:

* Building Siena From a Source Package

  These instructions assume that you have unpacked (or checked out)
  the Siena sources in $HOME/src/siena.  Then, in order to build
  Siena, do the following:

  1. create a build directory:

     > mkdir $HOME/build/siena

  2. configure the build environemnt:

     > cd $HOME/build/siena
     > $HOME/siena-2.0.0/configure

     you may have to tell the configure script where your Java
     binaries are installed (e.g., the javac compiler).  Also, if you
     intend to run the JUnit tests that come with Siena, you must have
     the JUnit library installed somewhere on your system.  In this
     example, we assume it is in $HOME/lib/java/junit-4.10.jar. (Basic jar,
     with hamcrest)

     > cd $HOME/build_siena
     > $HOME/src/siena/configure \
       		--with-javabin=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/bin \
		--with-classpath=$HOME/lib/java/junit-4.10.jar

  3. build the Siena API and server:

     > cd $HOME/build/siena
     > make

  4. test the system:

     > cd $HOME/build/siena
     > make test

  5. create the user documentation in $HOME/build/siena/doc/html:

     > cd $HOME/build/siena
     > make doc

     and consult the documentation starting from 
     $HOME/build/siena/doc/html/index.html

  6. manually install Siena and its documentation.  Here we assume
     that the Siena library will go in $HOME/lib/java and that the
     documentation will go into $HOME/doc/siena

     > cd $HOME/build/siena
     > mv -i siena-2.0.0.jar $HOME/lib
     > mv -i doc/html $HOME/doc/siena
