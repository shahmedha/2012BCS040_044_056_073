Communication mechanisms used by Siena.

<h3>Basic Communication in Siena</h3>

<p>The basis for communication between Siena components is a generic,
uni-directional, point-to-point, packet-based communication service.
In essence, this mechanism is an abstraction of a
<em>datagram link</em> between two components.  A link is defined by
the {@link siena.comm.PacketSender PacketSender} and {@link
siena.comm.PacketReceiver PacketReceiver} interfaces, representing the
sender's and receiver's ends respectively.

<p>As a first step in establishing a communication link, a receiver
creates a {@link siena.comm.PacketReceiver PacketReceiver} object.
Once a <code>PacketReceiver</code> is active, a sender can create a
corresponding {@link siena.comm.PacketSender PacketSender} object to
send packets to the receiver.  <code>PacketSender</code> objects are
created idirectly through {@link siena.comm.PacketSenderFactory
PacketSenderFactory}, using the receiver's {@link
siena.comm.PacketReceiver#address() external address}.  

<p>An <em>external address</em> of a <code>PacketReceiver</code> is a
byte string that serves as a universal locator for that receiver.  The
space of external addresses is obviously shared by all link types and
implementations.  Therefore, in order to partition the address space,
an external address must comply with the following syntax:

<p>
<em>address</em> ::=
<em>schema</em><code>:</code><em>schema-dependent-part</em>
<p>

Where <em>schema</em> is a short string, not containing the
<code>":"</code> (colon) charachter, that uniquely identifies the type
of receiver, and <em>schema-dependent-part</em> is another string
whose format is specific to that type of receiver.

<p>The current implementation of Siena provides three sender/receiver
implementation pairs:

<ul>
<li><code>KAPacketSender</code>/{@link siena.comm.KAPacketReceiver
KAPacketReceiver}: schema identifier <code>"ka"</code>.  Sends
packets through TCP connections.  This sender/receiver pair attempts
to maintain and reuse persistent TCP connections ("KA" stands for
<em>keep alive</em>).

<li><code>TCPPacketSender</code>/{@link siena.comm.TCPPacketReceiver
TCPPacketReceiver}: schema identifier <code>"tcp"</code>. sends
packets through TCP connections.  This sender/receiver pair uses one
connection per packet.

<li><code>UDPPacketSender</code>/{@link siena.comm.UDPPacketReceiver
UDPPacketReceiver}: schema identifier <code>"udp"</code>. Sends
packets using UDP datagrams.

<li><code>SSLPacketSender</code>/{@link siena.comm.SSLPacketReceiver
SSLPacketReceiver}: schema identifier <code>"ssl"</code>.  Sends
packets through persistent ssl connections.  This sender/receiver pair
attempts to maintain and reuse SSL connections.

</ul>

<h3>Extending the Communication Capabilities of Siena</h3>

Siena can be easily extended with new packet sender/receiver
implementation pairs.  For example, a developer may want to implement
a communication mechanism that uses, say, an infra-red port. In order
to do that, the developer must:

<ol>
<li>choose a globally unique schema identifier, for example <code>"ir"</code>.

<li>provide a pair of specific implementations of {@link
    siena.comm.PacketReceiver} and {@link siena.comm.PacketSender}
    that make use of the infra-red port.  For example, these could be
    called
    <code>org.xyz.IRPacketReceiver</code> and
    <code>org.xyz.IRPacketSender</code>.

<li>provide a specific sender factory, say
    <code>org.xyz.IRSenderFactory</code>, to be used directly by
    applications, or indirectly through the {@link
    siena.comm.GenericSenderFactory#registerFactory(String,PacketSenderFactory)
    factory registration} feature of {@link
    siena.comm.GenericSenderFactory}.
</ol>
