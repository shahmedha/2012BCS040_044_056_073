<h2>Basics</h2>

Siena is a publish/subscribe service. The abstract interface of Siena
is embodied in the {@link siena.Siena} interface.  An application
typically uses an implementation of the Siena interface to {@link
siena.Siena#publish(siena.Notification) publish} {@link
siena.Notification}s or to {@link siena.Siena#subscribe(siena.Filter,
siena.Notifiable) subscribe} for some notifications of interest.
<p>

<h3>Notifications</h3> 

An event notifications is a set of named attributes.  Each attribute
has a type and a value (see {@link siena.AttributeValue}).  For
example:
<p>
<table border=1><tr><td>
<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td><em>string</em> <td>stock <td>"XYZ"
<tr><td><em>int</em> <td>quantity <td>2500
<tr><td><em>float</em> <td>price <td>3.1415
</table>
</table>
<p>

Attribute names must be unique in a notifications.

<h3>Selection Mechanisms for Subscriptions</h3>

Siena offers two kinds of selection mechanisms:

<ul>
<li><em>filters</em> select one event notification at a time.  Filters
    are defined by the class {@link siena.Filter}.  A filter is a
    conjunction (logical <em>and</em>) of constraints on specific
    attributes of a notification (see {@link
    siena.AttributeConstraint}).  For example:
    <p>
    <table border=1><tr><td>
    <table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
    <tr><td><em>string</em><td>stock<td><td><b>=</b><td>"XYZ"
    <tr><td><em>int</em><td>quantity<td><td><b>&gt;</b><td>2000
    <tr><td><em>int</em><td>quantity<td><td><b>&lt;</b><td>3000
    <tr><td><em>float</em><td>price<td><td><b>&gt;</b><td>2.7818
    </table>
    </table>
    <p>

    A filter can have more than one constraint for the same
    attribute.

<li><em>patterns</em> select one or more notifications at a time.
    patterns are defined by the class {@link siena.Pattern}.
    The current implementation supports the simple form of pattern
    given by a sequence of filters. 
</ul>

<p>

<h3>How Notifications are Delivered to Subscribers</h3>

A subscriber must implement the {@link siena.Notifiable} interface.
Siena delivers notifications to a subscriber by calling the
<code>notify</code> method on the subscriber object.  Notifiable has
two variants of the notify method: {@link
siena.Notifiable#notify(siena.Notification) notify(Notification n)} is
called to notify a single notification, while {@link
siena.Notifiable#notify(siena.Notification[]) notify(Notification
s[])} is called to notify a sequence of notifications.
<p>

A subscriber must provide both implementations, even if it will never
receive sequences of notifications.  In this case, the subscriber can
implement:
<pre>
    public void notify(Notification[] s) {};
</pre>

<h2>How to Set Up a Siena Service</h2>

<h3>How to Access the Siena Service</h3>

Objects can publish or subscribe by accessing an implementation of
Siena.  The simplest way to access a Siena service is through a remote
service interface object.  This is essentially a <em>proxy</em> object
that sends every request to an external Siena server, and receives
incoming notifications.  The implementation of the proxy is provided
through the {@link siena.ThinClient} class.  A <code>ThinClient</code>
object implements the <code>Siena</code> interface, but it does not
provide a Siena service itself: it simply forwards every publication
and every subscription to the remote server, and passes any incoming
notification to its subscriber.

<p>Clients use a <code>ThinClient</code> just like any other Siena
interface.  A publisher creates a <code>ThinClient</code> object and
publishes notifications to it.  A subscriber creates a
<code>ThinClient</code> object and subscribes.

<p>For example:

<pre><code>
    ThinClient mySiena = new ThinClient("ka:host.domain:1111");
    Notifiable subscriber;
    // ... subscriber = ...

    Filter f = new Filter();
    f.addConstraint("message", OP.ANY, null);
    mySiena.subscribe(f, subscriber);

    // ...
    Notification n = new Notification();
    n.putAttribute("message","Hello, World!");
    mySiena.publish(n);
    // ...
</code></pre>


<h3>How to Set Up a Network of Siena Servers</h3>

You can run a stand-alone Siena server with {@link siena.StartDVDRPServer}.
For example:
<p>
<pre>
    java siena.StartDVDRPServer -id server1 -receiver ka:myhost.mydomain:1111
</pre>
starts up a Siena server on the local host, giving this server the
identifier "server1".  This server is also given a packet receiver
based on persistent TCP connections ("ka" type) on port 1111, and this
receiver is also given the host name "myhost.mydomain", so that it
would, if necessary, advertise that host name to other servers.

<p>
Once a server is up and running, you can control the configuration of
that server using the {@link siena.DVDRPControl} utility, and in
particular you can establish a connection between two servers.
Suppose that, in addition to the server started above, you also start
another server on some other machine otherhost.mydomain:

<p>
<pre>
    java siena.StartDVDRPServer -id server2 -receiver ka:otherhost.mydomain:2222
</pre>

and yet another server 

<p>
<pre>
    java siena.StartDVDRPServer -id server3 -receiver ka:thirdhost.mydomain:3333
</pre>

<p>
Now, you can tell the first server to connect to the other two:

<p>
<pre>
    java siena.DVDRPControl ka:myhost.mydomain:1111 connect server2 ka:otherhost.mydomain:2222
    java siena.DVDRPControl ka:myhost.mydomain:1111 connect server3 ka:thirdhost.mydomain:3333
</pre>

which forms a triangle-shaped network of Siena DVDRP servers.
As the example shows, the broker topology need not be a tree.
When a cyclic topology like above is formed, brokers route messages on trees
in order to avoid cycles. By default the cost of each inter-broker link is one. You
can specify the cost of a link by passing a last argument to
siena.DVDRPControl. In this case brokers route messages on the shortest
path they compute given the cost of each link. As an example the following link has a cost of 10:

<pre>
    java siena.DVDRPControl ka:myhost.mydomain:1111 connect server2 ka:otherhost.mydomain:2222 <b>10</b>
</pre>

<p>
To disconnect an already established inter-broker link, use the command
<b>disconnect</b>. For example, to remove the above link issue the following:
</p>
<pre>
    java siena.DVDRPControl ka:myhost.mydomain:1111 disconnect server2
</pre>

<p>
To create large topologies you can specify a configuration file to the control
tool, with one command per line. Lines starting with '#' will be ignored.
</p>

<pre>
    java siena.DVDRPControl -f &lt;configuration-file&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Receivers and Transport Protocols</h3>
<p>
The communication of brokers with other brokers and clients can be over TCP or
UDP. This is specified as a command line option as you saw before, when
starting a Siena broker:
</p>

<pre>
    java siena.StartDVDRPServer -id server2 -receiver ka:otherhost.mydomain:2222
</pre>
<p>
This specifier tells the broker how to receive incoming requests.
The format of receiver specifier is as follows :
</p>

<pre>
    transport_type:host_address:listening_port:[receiver_threads_num]
</pre>

<p>
Where the last part (<i><b>receiver_threads_num</b></i>) determines the number of threads 
to be used to maintain persistent TCP connection (with <b><i>ka</i></b> transport explained
below). This part of specifier is optional and has a default value of 5.
<br>
<b><i>transport_type</i></b> must be one of the following:
</p>

<p>
<b><i>tcp:</i></b> On demand TCP connection. With this option a TCP connection
is made to send each message and is terminated once sending is complete. Note
that if you have very high message send/receive rates this type of connection 
is very likely to cause message loss since closing and initiating connections 
takes a relatively long time. You can detect this problem, for instance by 
seeing a client throwing an instance of siena.comm.PacketSenderException 
upon publishing a message.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>ka:</i></b> Persistent TCP connection (keep-alive). With this option a
TCP connection begins the first time a message is to be sent and is maintained until explicitly terminated.
 This connection type is best appropriate for inter-broker links or for high rate publishers/subscribers. 
 </p>
<!-- Is this true ?
Notice that with this option, the number of receiver threads
(<i><b>receiver_threads_num</b></i>) should not be less that the number of
concurrent connections to the broker otherwise message losses will be 
occur.-->

<p>
<b><i>udp:</i></b> UDP connection. With this type of connection messages incur
smaller delivery delays. It is suitable in cases where a broker
serves many clients (e.g., more than 1 thousand concurrent clients).
</p>
